          <div className="text-gray-300 mt-6">
            A static website is a type of website that consists of a set of HTML
            pages that remain unchanged until they are manually updated. Unlike
            dynamic websites, which retrieve information from a database and
            display it in real-time, static websites are pre-built and display
            the same content to all users.
            <br />
            <br />
            One of the main benefits of a static website is its simplicity.
            Because they do not require a database or server-side scripting,
            they are easy to create, host, and maintain. This makes them ideal
            for small businesses, personal websites, and portfolios, where the
            focus is on showcasing content rather than providing interactive
            experiences.
            <br /> <br />
            Static websites also load faster than dynamic websites, as they do
            not require complex processes to retrieve information from a
            database. This can improve the user experience, especially on mobile
            devices with slow internet connections. Another advantage of static
            websites is their improved security. Because they do not use
            databases or server-side scripting, they are less vulnerable to
            hacking and other security threats.
            <br />
            <br />
            In conclusion, a static website is a great choice for businesses or
            individuals who want a simple, fast, and secure website that
            showcases content without the need for dynamic features. If you’re
            looking for a no-fuss solution for your online presence, a static
            website is a great place to start.
