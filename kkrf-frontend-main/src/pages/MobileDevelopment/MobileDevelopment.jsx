                            The major mobile app development platforms are iOS (Apple) and Android (Google). They differ in
                            terms of programming languages and development tools. iOS apps are typically developed using
                            Swift or Objective-C and require a Mac computer, while Android apps are developed in Java or Kotlin
                            and are more flexible in terms of hardware. Developers often choose platforms based on their target
                            audience and project requirements.

                            The choice of development approach depends on various factors:
                            Native Apps: Provide the best performance and user experience but require separate codebases for
                            iOS and Android. Choose native if performance is critical and you have the resources.
                            Hybrid Apps: Use web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and can be deployed on multiple
                            platforms. They offer faster development and reduced costs but might not achieve the same level of
                            performance.
                            Progressive Web Apps (PWAs): Web apps with app-like features. They work across platforms and are
                            easy to update but have limited access to device features. Choose PWAs for content-based apps or if
                            you want a wider reach.
